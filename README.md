# Mall_data_kmeans_clustering
Have a rigorous description for k-means algorithm for customer segmentation for Shopping Mall

**The Problem:**

**Malls or shopping complexes are often indulged in the race to increase their customers and hence making huge profits. To achieve this task machine learning is being applied by many stores already.
It is amazing to realize the fact that how machine learning can aid in such ambitions. The shopping complexes make use of their customersâ€™ data and develop ML models to target the right ones. This not only increases sales but also makes the complexes efficient.**


**Future Work:**

By the end of this case study , you would be able to answer below questions.

*1- How to achieve customer segmentation using machine learning algorithm (KMeans Clustering) in Python in simplest way.*

*2- Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing strategy [easy to converse]*

*3- How the marketing strategy works in real world*
